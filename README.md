## Inspiration
The idea behind the app comes from the pain point that all of our team members experience when trying to invest in the stock markets. How do I open a brokage account? What stocks should I invest in? How do I easily track our investments? We learned that we are not alone. Scott, our team member from Indonesia, found out that only 0.3% of his country's population invests in the stock market. 

A lack of active retail investor community in the domestic stock market is very problematic. Investment in the stock markets is one of the most important factors that contribute to the economic growth of a country. This is the problem that we want to address.
